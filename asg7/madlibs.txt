Today I went to my favorite Taco Stand called the quirky cat. Unlike most food stands, they cook and prepare the food in a car while you kick. The best thing on the menu is the red clown. Instead of ground beef they fill the taco with chips, cheese, and top it off with a salsa made from potatoes. If that doesn't make your mouth water, then it' just like me always says: OH!

It was another late night study session in the LOCATION. I was studying for my CLASS SUBJECT exam when a ADJECTIVE ANIMAL entered the room and told me to hand in ADJECTIVE FOOD I was eating. I said that I am a hungry student and this is the only food I have left for the semester. But the ADJECTIVE ANIMAL did not want to take a no as an answer, so I had to call my ADJECTIVE NOUN for help. ADJECTIVE NOUN quickly came and saved me from the hangry  ANIMAL.
